# Kyverno Demo

## Setting up the demo with the devcontainer
This demo shows how to use Kyverno to enforce policies on Kubernetes resources. You can use the devcontainer following this repo. The devcontainer has all the tools installed to run the demo. 

## Setting up the demo without the devcontainer
First, you will need to have _kind_ installed. You can find instructions on how to install _kind_ [here](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
